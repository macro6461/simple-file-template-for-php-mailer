#simple-php-mailer-template

I am aware that there is already a repo for PHPMailer assets which can be found at https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer. I was asked by a few friends to just upload a folder containing my file structure to which PHPMailer is implemented already. It contains a downloaded PHPMailer library, as well as a starter form and mailer.php file to implement with the library and the form. All that needs to be added is the gmail credentials, the redirect URL upon success and styling.
